# This is Your Music On Brain

## Getting Started

Setup:

1. Clone this project
2. Navigate to project root directory.
3. Install python packages using `pip3 install requirements.txt`. If this command does not work, ensure you have `pip` installed ([instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)).

Running:

1. Navigate to project root directory.
2. Copy `keys-example.py` into the same directory, name it `keys.py`, and enter your Spotify API keys into the corresponding blanks.
3. Start the python backend using `python3 app.py`
4. A new browser window will pop up prompting you to log into spotify. Before logging in, you must be registered as a spotify developer.
5. Wait for the backend to finish loading all your songs. This takes a minute or two.
6. Open the app. By default, the app can be found in `http://localhost:8888/static/index.html`
